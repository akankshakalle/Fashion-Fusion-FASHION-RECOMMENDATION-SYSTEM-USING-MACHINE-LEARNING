# Fashion Recommender System

A deep learning-based **Fashion Recommender System** using **ResNet50** for image feature extraction and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for similarity search.

## Features
- Uses **ResNet50** (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract image features.
- Computes similarity using **Euclidean distance**.
- Implements a **Streamlit-based UI** for easy image uploads and recommendations.
- Supports **real-time image similarity search**.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-recommender.git
cd fashion-recommender
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
#### Windows:
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```
#### Mac/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download or Prepare the Image Dataset
- Place your images inside an **`images/`** directory.
- Ensure all images are in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format.

### 5. Extract Features from Images
Run the following script to extract image features and store them in **Pickle** files:
```bash
python extract_features.py
```
This will generate two files:
- `embeddings.pkl` (Feature vectors of images)
- `filenames.pkl` (Corresponding image filenames)

### 6. Run the Streamlit App
Start the recommender system by running:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 7. Upload an Image and Get Recommendations
- Upload an image via the Streamlit UI.
- The system will display the top 5 most similar images from the dataset.
